# us-states-game
State guessing game made using Pandas and Turtle Graphics in Python. Pulls state names and x/y map coordinates from a CSV. If the player gives up, will create a text file of unguessed states.

Issue to be aware of: Text box for user's guess is in kind of an aswkward position that covers up a bunch of the Midwest states on the map. There doesn't appear to be a way to change textinput locations in Turtle. (I'll probably need to remake this project later when I know how to use something more sophisticated than Turtle.)
